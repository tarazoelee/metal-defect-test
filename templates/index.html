            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                In the material manufacturing industry, 
                surface defects can cause major issues in a material. 
                A simple surface scratch can initiate crack propagation and cause a structure to fail, thus potentially putting human lives at risk. 
                However, having humans inspect for defects in a product is both very expensive, inefficient, and inaccurate way to solve this problem. 
                Using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect  defects in cold rolled steel, 
                for example, is a much more accurate way to ensure that materials are produced with high quality
                <br><br>
                By integrating computer vision into manufacturing, companies could increase the amount of
                 high quality products being sold and identify how subtle changes in the manufacturing process are changing the quality of the product.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p><strong>Machine Learning Model: </strong><br><br>
                Train a model that can identify metal defects with >95% accuracy. 
                Training data will only contain microscoped images of rolled metal sheets.
                Use tensorflow sequential model to label model
                <br><br>
                <strong>Deployment:</strong><br><br>
                Deploy a website that can allow users to upload an image in the form of PNG or JPEG, JPG and tell the user whether input is an unaccepted file type.
                present the output of the model in a clear way, describing each defect and its effects on the metal. 
                It should have an aesthetically pleasant appearance. 
                Should contain a list of all the members involved and their LinkedIn profile address
                Show CUCAI paper <br><br>
                <strong>Technologies: </strong><br><br>
                The website will use Flask as its framework, HTML and Bootstrap for its appearance. Javascript will be used to add functionality to the buttons and its appearance. Tensorflow will be used to create the model and the training data will be sourced from Kaggle
